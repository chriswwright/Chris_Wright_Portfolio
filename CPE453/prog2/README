This first major difference between this lwp library and a real thread
management library is that the kernel never learns about new threads. This means
that multicore operation is impossible. Another thing is that once the lwp
starts, the starting process is not a thread itself. This means that the
starting process stops while the lwps are running meaning that the main process
cannot tell its threads to stop or change mode. Similarly our threads cannot
communicate with each other or the main process meaning they cannot try and
access the same reasources. Finally there is no process for creating shared
memory between threads. This is problem for single instruction, multiple data
applications, which are a major application of thread control libraries.
